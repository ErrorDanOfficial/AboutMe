Goal of the Game:

The goal of the game is to leave the opponent with no digits in their number.

How to Play:

Start the Game: To begin, both players input their numbers in the fields (or just use randomizer). It’s important that both player's numbers have the same number of digits (otherwise, the game won’t start).
Gameplay: Players take turns. Each turn consists of removing a digit from the player’s number and attempting to remove digits from the opponent’s number. Digits are removed based on a strategy: if the digits match in parity (even or odd), they will be removed from the opponent's number.
Winning: The game continues until one player has no digits left in their number.
